Alongside hiragana and katakana, kanji are one of the three scripts that make up written Japanese. </p><p>Each kanji character represents a meaning (or concept), and often has multiple readings depending on context. For example:</p><ul><li>山 means &quot;mountain&quot; <ul><li>Read as yama (やま) when standing alone</li><li>Read as san (さん) in compound words, like 富士山 (Fujisan – Mt. Fuji)</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="col-12"><h5>A Brief History</h5><p>Kanji originated from Chinese characters and were introduced to Japan over 1,500 years ago. At first, they were used mainly by scholars and monks, but over time they became a core part of everyday Japanese writing.</p><h5>Why Learn Kanji?</h5><p>You might be wondering: <b>Do I have to learn kanji?</b> Yes—if you want to read and write Japanese with any fluency.</p><label for="">Here’s why kanji are essential:</label><ul><li><b>Clarity:</b> Japanese has many homophones. Kanji helps differentiate them. <ul><li>Example: こうこう could mean &quot;high school (高校)&quot; or &quot;navigation (航行)&quot;</li></ul></li><li><b>Efficiency:</b> A single kanji can pack a lot of meaning into one character.</li><li><b>Authenticity:</b> Native-level Japanese includes thousands of kanji in books, newspapers, signs, and more.</li></ul></div><div class="col-12"><h5>How Many Kanji Are There?</h5><p>There are thousands of kanji, but don’t worry—you don’t need to learn them all at once.</p><ul><li>The Japanese government defines 2,136 &quot;Jōyō Kanji&quot; (常用漢字) as the essential characters for daily use.</li><li>Most educated Japanese adults know between 2,000–3,000 kanji.</li></ul><p>For beginners, learning the first 100–300 kanji will unlock a surprising amount of reading ability. </p><h5>Types of Kanji Readings</h5><p>Kanji have two main types of readings:</p><ol><li>On&#39;yomi (音読み) – &quot;Sino-Japanese&quot; reading (from Chinese)</li><li>Kun&#39;yomi (訓読み) – Native Japanese reading</li></ol><p>Example:</p><ul><li>水 (water) <ul><li>On’yomi: sui (used in compounds like 水曜日 – Suiyōbi, Wednesday)</li><li>Kun’yomi: mizu (used when standing alone)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Learning when to use each takes time—but it becomes natural with practice and exposure.</p></div><div class="col-12"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8 alert alert-info"><h5>Tips for Learning Kanji</h5><ul><li>Learn kanji in context – with vocabulary, not just as isolated characters.</li><li>Use mnemonics – create stories or visuals to remember meanings.</li><li>Practice writing by hand – it helps reinforce stroke order and memory.</li><li>Start with JLPT levels or by frequency – many learners follow JLPT lists (N5-N1).</li><li>Use spaced repetition (SRS) – tools like Anki or WaniKani help with long-term retention. </li></ul></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-4 d-flex justify-content-center flex-column align-items-center"><img src="'+a+'" alt="" style="width:70%;"><button class="btn btn-outline-success form-control">Would you like a practice?</button></div></div></div>',4)]))}const p=i(s,[["render",r]]);export{p as default};
