            <h4>Causative Verb Conjugation in Japanese</h4>
            <p>The causative verb form in Japanese expresses the idea of making someone do something or letting them
                do something. In English, it's similar to saying "to make [someone] do [something]" or "to let
                [someone] do [something]."</p>
            <span>For example:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>"I made my brother eat lunch."</li>
                <li>"She let her child play outside."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Japanese, the causative form is created by modifying the verb's base form. Below are the
                conjugation rules for different verb types, followed by examples in both polite and casual speech.

            <h5>Using the Causative Form to Allow Someone to Do Something</h5>
            <p>In addition to making someone do something, you can also use the causative form to express allowing
                someone to do something.
                <br>
                To express letting or allowing someone do something, the causative form is used, but the nuance is
                different from "making" someone do it. The causative form in this context is often translated as "to
                let" or "to allow".
